 # KoloS
 
🤟 This is my fun challenge.

🚜 It is a design mix for soil restoration while preserving the environment.

⚙️ I took what I had in the garage and behind it:
```
  - energy from a socket
  - some plumbing and farm tools
  - electric sharpener 380V
  - a frequency converter
  - cultivator on the fuel of petroleum products
  - a piece of land with soil and dry grass
```
