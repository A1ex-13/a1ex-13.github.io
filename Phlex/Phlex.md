#  Phlex 

## A modified water handling unit is a device that regulates the concentration of phosphate ions [PO4] and circulates water as part of an installation system.

### Components:

– Supply tube;

– Mixed zone;

– Outlet tube;

– ✨-component;

– Controls;

> ###  Contraindication:
> `[theory not proven, this assumption]`; 
> is a specific situation in which a **Phlex**, should not be used because it may be harmful to the person. 
> For example, "✨-component" used to reaction is absolutely contraindicated;

```
 The task is to detect whether all the elements are mixed or not and to separate them if necessary.
```
